* Automatic export
** Create rule
1. Right-click a library or collection in the left Zotero pane.
2. Select "Export Collection".
3. Set the export "Format" to "Better BibLaTeX" and check "Keep updated". Any changes to the library or collection will trigger automatic re-export.
   1. Note that Better BibLaTeX supports "software" items (Better BibTeX exports them as "misc") such as are created when archiving a GitHub page.
4. Set ~bibtex-completion-bibliography~ to the export path.
5. To ensure subcollections are included in the export, in Zotero's advanced configuration set extensions.zotero.recursiveCollections to true.
6. To edit existing export rules, navigate to: "Zotero", "Preferences", "Better BibTeX", "Automatic export".
   1. To export URLs, check "Export unicode as plain-text latex commands (recommended)".
